### 12. Recommendations

Based on the analysis of channel performance, ad format effectiveness, temporal trends, and industry benchmarks, the following strategic recommendations are proposed to **AdTech Solutions Inc.** to achieve the 2025 goals of increasing **ROAS by 15%** and reducing **CPA by 10%**:

#### üì¢ Channel Strategy

- **Prioritize Affiliate Channels**  
  Affiliate campaigns deliver the highest average ROAS (**46.444**) and the lowest cost exposure relative to revenue. Allocate additional budget toward affiliate campaigns for performance-focused growth.


- **Reallocate from Underperforming Search Ads**  
  While Search Engine ads generate the highest total revenue, they lag in ROAS and consume higher ad spend. Shift a portion of this budget to affiliate and social media channels where return efficiency is stronger.


#### üéØ Creative Optimization

- **Invest in Video for Reach, Text for Conversion**  
  Use **Video ads** for awareness (highest impressions, clicks, leads), but complement with **Text ads** in remarketing flows due to their **highest conversion rate (0.01755)** and **lowest CPA (27.45)**.

- **Monitor High-Spend Creatives**  
  Video formats lead in revenue but account for **$24.5M+ in ad spend**. Implement spending thresholds or ROI-based creative gating to prevent inefficient budget drains.

#### üïô Time-Based Campaign Scheduling

- **Double Down on 10 AM Slots**  
  Ads at **10 AM** produced the highest revenue (**$86.1M**) and lowest CPC (**$1.038**). Use automated bid boosts and priority delivery settings during this hour.

- **Avoid 2 PM Without Creative Adjustment**  
  Despite high revenue uplift at **2 PM**, CTR is the lowest. Recommend A/B testing new creatives or frequency-capping during this hour.

#### üè≠ Industry-Specific Targeting

- **Favor Telecom Sector**  
  Telecom campaigns outperformed Retail across all KPIs: ROAS, revenue, lead generation, CTR, and CPA. Recommend expanding Telecom-targeted investments in Q1‚ÄìQ2 2025.

- **Refine Retail Bidding Strategy**  
  Retail shows competitive CTR and CPC but lower lead gen and ROAS. Apply more granular segmentation and test lower bid ceilings to boost return efficiency.

#### üìä Operational Efficiency

- **Ad Spend Auditing**  
  Automatically flag and pause campaigns with **CPA > $40** or **ROAS < 1.0** for review. Introduce exception monitoring logic into campaign workflows.

- **Introduce Efficiency Scoring**  
  Implement a real-time **Efficiency Score** (`Revenue √∑ Ad Spend`) in internal dashboards to track and optimize performance continuously.

### 13. Future Work  
1. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - ROAS forecasting using CTR/CPA regression (Q3 2025)  
2. **Cross-Channel Attribution**  
   - Integrate Google Analytics pathing data (Q4 2024)  
3. **Creative Fatigue Analysis**  
   - Track CTR decay by ad version and refresh cycles  
4. **LTV Integration**  
   - Augment CPA with 90-day customer lifetime value

### 15. Assumptions and Caveats  
1. **Revenue Calculation**  
   - Assumes CPA includes all acquisition costs (excludes churn)  
2. **Time Zone Handling**  
   - All timestamps in UTC without localization  
3. **ROAS Baseline**  
   - "Baseline revenue" not formally defined; used campaign averages  
4. **Seasonality Impact**  
   - Q4 holiday effects not isolated in YoY comparisons
